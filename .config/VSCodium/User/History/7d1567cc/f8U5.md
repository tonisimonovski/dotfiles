Changing the Username

Once you have completed the preparation, follow these steps to change your username in Linux:
1. Log in as Root or Use sudo:

To change a username, you need to have administrative access. Log in as the root user or use the sudo command to run the necessary commands with elevated privileges.
2. Change the Username:

Open a terminal and run the following command:

sudo usermod -l new_username old_username

 

Replace new_username with your desired new username and old_username with your current username. This command modifies the username in the system.

3. Update the Home Directory:

Next, run the following command to update the home directory associated with the new username:

sudo usermod -d /home/new_username -m new_username

 

This command ensures that your home directory is correctly updated to match the new username.

Post-Username Change Steps

After changing your username, it is essential to update certain system configurations and settings to reflect the new username. Here are a few areas that require attention:
1. File Ownership and Permissions:

Update file ownership and permissions to match the new username. Run the following command to recursively change ownership:

sudo chown -R new_username: /home/new_username

 

This command ensures that all files and directories in the home directory are owned by the new username. 





Changing Username while Logged in as the User

You can change your username while logged in as the user; however, some additional steps are required to ensure a seamless transition. Follow these steps to change your username while logged in:

Step 1: Open a terminal.

Step 2: Run the command 

sudo usermod -l new_username old_username

 

Replace new_username with your desired new username and old_username with your current username.

Step 3: Run the command 

sudo usermod -d /home/new_username -m new_username

 

This command ensures that your home directory is correctly updated to match the new username. 

Please note that after changing your username, you need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.
